    NOTES = '''I have a strong interest in filmmaking and possess over three years of experience in account acquisition, product lifecycle management, and growth strategies that I cultivated during my time at Palantir. I am looking forward to applying my technical expertise and strategic insights to contribute to Pika's pioneering product leadership, foster its growth, and boost its adoption.

In my previous role, I successfully led the development of custom enterprise products, generating revenue of $24 million across various accounts. This success was achieved through identifying market opportunities, creating user-focused solutions, and building robust relationships at all levels within the organization, from end-users to executive suite. More recently, I was at the helm of a 12-person engineering team where I drove the acquisition and upscaling of manufacturing accounts by developing custom AI solutions.

Since July, I have been conducting a series of hackathons and bootcamps for technical users. These efforts have resulted in nine new contracts and increased active engagement with existing clients. My role at Palantir and for our clients encompassed everything from product roadmap planning and execution to designing architecture, scoping use cases, and fostering user community growth.

I am particularly proud of leading the design and implementation efforts for Palantir's Scenarios product as the primary user-facing associate. This product was adopted by our entire user base within six months of launch thanks to simplified UX, scalable workflows, and successful client showcases.

I believe in the power of collaboration and always seek to work with teams composed of individuals who are exceptional, kind-hearted, and motivated by collective achievement. I'm committed to providing the resources my team needs, fostering a sense of shared responsibility, and ensuring skills are allocated in a way that meets the business needs effectively.

My passion for filmmaking and technology combined with analytical expertise, aligns well with Pika's mission to revolutionize expression through AI. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to its rapid growth. I am eager to discuss how I can apply my experience and growth-oriented product expertise to help position Pika as a leader in AI-powered video creation, democratize creative tools, and establish a new standard.'''
