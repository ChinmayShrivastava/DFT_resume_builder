        "explanation": "Because this position requires a product manager with experience in consumer-facing product management and strong customer empathy, the resume should benefit from the applicant's demonstrable success in launching user-centric features at Brex (like user onboarding improvements that led to a 10% increase in onboarding rates) and the experience at Microsoft in driving user growth and NPS improvement. Because the role involves leading cross-functional teams and navigating product scale challenges in a high-growth environment, the resume should benefit from the applicant's leadership in prioritizing features with a 20-person team and expanding usage from 1,000 to 1 million monthly users at Microsoft. Because the role calls for a growth mindset and detail-orientation, the resume should benefit from mentioning the introduction of WhatsApp-based phone verification at Brex and developing predictive sleep models at HCI Lab.

I currently work as a Product Manager at Brex in New York where I have recently launched user onboarding for the mobile app, this resulted to a 10% increase in onboarding rates.\n2. I also introduced the concept of time-zones across Brex, thus enhancing user experience for global users and paving the way for key Brex initiatives.\n3. By introducing WhatsApp-based phone verification to combat unreliable cell service, we noticed a 5% increase in user onboarding.\n4. I have also contributed to the hiring process by leading over 45 candidate interviews across various levels within our product team.\n5. Prior to Brex, my stint at Microsoft, Redmond as a Product Manager saw me lead the creation of the simplified view of the M365 Admin Center, resulting in +12% NPS.\n6. I was instrumental in growing the active usage count from 1,000 to 1 million monthly users in one year and led an initiative to grow the Admin Center\u2019s business.\n7. As a Software Engineering Intern at Facebook, I worked on improving machine learning models for better spam detection on Facebook and Instagram by up to 50%.\n8. At the HCI Lab, Brown University, I designed predictive sleep models by analyzing an enormous amount of sleep data from a vast number of users, which provided personalized insights on better sleep.\n9. Alongside these, I've also been active in the World Economic Forum as a Global Shaper, where I managed to raise $900k by writing grants and fundraising for land equity and repatriation to the Duwamish tribe.\n10. With an entrepreneurial streak, I co-founded Pampr.us, where we built an AI-based skincare recommendations app by conducting extensive user research and functional prototyping.\n11. My other entrepreneurial venture, Humans AI in India, saw me drive client acquisition and product development, providing alternative income for over 50 marginalized families.\nExplanation: Because this position requires a product manager with experience in consumer-facing product management and strong customer empathy, the resume should benefit from the applicant's demonstrable success in launching user-centric features at Brex (like user onboarding improvements that led to a 10% increase in onboarding rates) and the experience at Microsoft in driving user growth and NPS improvement. Because the role involves leading cross-functional teams and navigating product scale challenges in a high-growth environment, the resume should benefit from the applicant's leadership in prioritizing features with a 20-person team and expanding usage from 1,000 to 1 million monthly users at Microsoft. Because the role calls for a growth mindset and detail-orientation, the resume should benefit from mentioning the introduction of WhatsApp-based phone verification at Brex and developing predictive sleep models at HCI Lab. Because the role requires managing cross-functional collaboration and execution, the applicant's experience in leading over 45 candidate interviews and co-founding ventures like Pampr.us and Humans AI indicates well-rounded team management and entrepreneurship skills, valuable for a high-impact role at Square. Lastly, the role requires someone with a passion for economic empowerment, and the applicant's involvement with the World Economic Forum and fundraising for the Duwamish tribe showcases a commitment to social impact matching the company\u2019s values.\nResume: \nPROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE\nBrex, Product Manager, New York, NY May 2022 - Present \u22c5 Launched user onboarding on the mobile app leading to a 10% increase in onboarding rates \u22c5 Introduced the concept of time-zones across Brex resulting in a better user experience for\nglobal users and unblocking key Brex future initiatives including travel\n\u22c5 Shipped whatsapp based phone verification by recognizing the unmet need and future im-\npact from unreliable cell service, resulting in a 5% increase in user onboarding\n\u22c5 Helped grow the product team by leading over 45 candidate interviews across all levels\n\n\nMicrosoft, Product Manager, Redmond, WA July 2019 - May 2022\n\u22c5 Drove the creation of the simplified view of the M365 Admin Center by leading design\nsprints, research, and prioritizing features with a 20 person team resulting in +12% NPS\n\u22c5 Grew active usage from 1000 to 1 million monthly users in 1 year by expanding eligibility,\nincreasing functionality, and converting existing customers (https://bit.ly/3jUP4Tq)\n\u22c5 Led the business growth initiative for the Admin Center by revamping the purchasing expe-\nrience and creating a new page to discover relevant products\n\n\nFacebook, Software Engineering Intern, Menlo Park, CA May 2018 - August 2018\n\u22c5 Improved machine learning models using advanced sampling algorithms and statistical\nmethods resulting in up to 50% better spam detection on Facebook and Instagram\n\u22c5 Developed the quarterly road-map and annual metrics roadmap working with product lead\nand 9 team managers to deduplicate, defragment and prioritize projects across teams\n\n\nHCI Lab, Researcher, Brown University May 2017 - May 2019\n\u22c5 Designed predictive sleep models by analyzing 10+ million nights of sleep data from 60k+\nusers leading to personalized insights on better sleep\n\n\nLEADERSHIP AND ACTIVITIES\nWorld Economic Forum, Global Shaper, Seattle, WA Jan 2021 - Present \u22c5 Raised $900k as a part of Global Shapers, WEF\u2019s volunteer arm, by writing grants, and fundraising for land equity and repatriation to the Duwamish tribe (seattleshapers.org)\n\n\nPampr.us, Co-Founder, New York City, NY Nov 2020 - Dec 2021 \u22c5 Built an AI-based skincare recommendations app by working with a designer on 20 user\nresearch interviews, 3 branding proposals, and 2 functional prototypes\n\n\nHumans AI, Co-Founder, India Feb 2020 - Oct 2020 \u22c5 Drove client acquisition and product development with a team of 6 engineers building an\nimage labeling platform resulting in alternative income for 50+ marginalized families\n\n"
