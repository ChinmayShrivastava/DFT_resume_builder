        "notes": "My most recent experience is with a company called Sonder based in San Francisco, CA, where I worked as a Product Manager between 2020 and 2023. I successfully collaborated with the senior leadership team to outline a medium and long-term roadmap for their guest app. This includes the redesign of the main 'stays' page, which led to an increase in customer engagement and self-service by 15% YOY. Additionally, I introduced some features that allowed guests to manage early check-in and late check-out requests independently. Also, I launched an on-demand housekeeping feature.\n\nBefore Sonder, I worked as an MBA intern in the role of Product Manager at Airbnb during 2019. During this tenure, I conceptualised and executed a pilot consumer offering in only five weeks. I also defined the technical requirements and user journey for an experimental grocery feature in Sonder's guest app. In addition, I created a framework that evaluated 11 services based on qualitative and quantitative user research.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2018, I worked as a Product Manager at HelloFresh based in New York, NY. During this period, I launched an overhaul of the business intelligence system, which led to efficiency increases and cost savings. I implemented improvements in data integrations and UI enhancements, which reduced recipe evaluation time by about 30%. This eliminated redundant data entries. I also developed a methodology for translating regional ingredient cost data into national projections.\n\nI've also had experience in Berlin at Zalando as Principal Product Manager in 2023. Here, I led inventory distribution and built complex products focused on returns management, lead time improvements and flawless choice. I spearheaded experimentation and discovery for group portfolio initiatives, leading three experiments with dozens of stakeholders.\n\nI worked as the Chief Growth Officer at Blok in Barcelona during 2021. During this period, I led product and growth initiatives, resulting in the successful acquisition of 10,000 customers, 30% stickiness, and a 12% activation rate. The company was subsequently acquired by Getir in July 2021.\n\nMy experience also includes working as the Product Lead at Mercedes-Benz.io from 2018 to 2021. I led a team of 30 FTE to launch and grow the Bertha app to 1M downloads, 40% retention, and 4.5 stars in app stores.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2023, I worked for Capital One in San Francisco, CA. As a Product Manager for B2B Payments, I implemented the use of OKRs in the organization.

        "fewshot_prompt": "Job Description: \n\n\nJD:\nCompany Description\nSince we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn\u2019t work together.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we expanded into software and built integrated solutions to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we\u2019ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.\n\n\nToday, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes \u2013 large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We\u2019re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.\nJob Description\nThe restaurant industry is at an inflection point where technology is becoming more important than ever in shaping a restaurant's success. The Square for Restaurants team is helping restaurants build and grow smart businesses that can shapeshift to adapt to evolving diner demands, all while maintaining a sense of hospitality.\n\n\nYou will report to the Head of Product, Restaurants and focus on helping restaurants start, run and grow their businesses through building products that automate and elevate every part of the flow of their service.\n\n\nTo be successful in this role, you should be able to transform a deep empathy of a restaurant's needs and pains into elegant software, to think tactically and strategically, to manage deep cross-functional collaboration and execution. You must also be able to drive growth metrics and own the details of the solution from deep in the stack through the end-user experience.\n\n\nIf you're looking to work at a high-growth company, drive impact on widely used products and change the way the restaurant industry works on a global scale you will find this role compelling, challenging, and rewarding.\n\n\nYou Will:\n\n\nWork closely with restaurant owners and staff to deeply understand their needs, what keeps them up at night and how they run their business and serve their diners.\nIn collaboration with design, engineering, marketing, and analytics partners, lead the end-to-end success of projects from discovery to launch\nIdentify new growth opportunities through quantitative research, UX studies, and reviews of industry standard methodologies\nInfluence and inspire key stakeholders and cross-functional peers and executives throughout Square to align intent, resources, and prioritization and deliver excellent products and services\nQualifications\nYou Have:\n\n\nMinimum of 3 years of consumer-facing product management experience\nPassion for our purpose of economic empowerment and helping sellers succeed\nStrong customer empathy and experience shaping product direction based on customer needs\nCreate solid relationships that shine when you're talking with a customer, cross-functional partner, or engaging a diverse audience\nNatural curiosity and growth mindset, obsession with the details\nNavigated product scale challenges in a high growth environment\nProven experience delivering results\n\n\n\nNotes: My most recent experience is with a company called Sonder based in San Francisco, CA, where I worked as a Product Manager between 2020 and 2023. I successfully collaborated with the senior leadership team to outline a medium and long-term roadmap for their guest app. This includes the redesign of the main 'stays' page, which led to an increase in customer engagement and self-service by 15% YOY. Additionally, I introduced some features that allowed guests to manage early check-in and late check-out requests independently. Also, I launched an on-demand housekeeping feature.\n\nBefore Sonder, I worked as an MBA intern in the role of Product Manager at Airbnb during 2019. During this tenure, I conceptualised and executed a pilot consumer offering in only five weeks. I also defined the technical requirements and user journey for an experimental grocery feature in Sonder's guest app. In addition, I created a framework that evaluated 11 services based on qualitative and quantitative user research.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2018, I worked as a Product Manager at HelloFresh based in New York, NY. During this period, I launched an overhaul of the business intelligence system, which led to efficiency increases and cost savings. I implemented improvements in data integrations and UI enhancements, which reduced recipe evaluation time by about 30%. This eliminated redundant data entries. I also developed a methodology for translating regional ingredient cost data into national projections.\n\nI've also had experience in Berlin at Zalando as Principal Product Manager in 2023. Here, I led inventory distribution and built complex products focused on returns management, lead time improvements and flawless choice. I spearheaded experimentation and discovery for group portfolio initiatives, leading three experiments with dozens of stakeholders.\n\nI worked as the Chief Growth Officer at Blok in Barcelona during 2021. During this period, I led product and growth initiatives, resulting in the successful acquisition of 10,000 customers, 30% stickiness, and a 12% activation rate. The company was subsequently acquired by Getir in July 2021.\n\nMy experience also includes working as the Product Lead at Mercedes-Benz.io from 2018 to 2021.

During this time, I partnered with the senior leadership team to devise the medium and long-term roadmap for the guest app. I led the initiative to redesign the \"stays\" page, boosting engagement and self-service by 15%.

Prior to my tenure at Sonder, I also worked as a Product Manager intern for Airbnb in San Francisco in 2019. In this capacity, I designed and implemented a pilot project for a new consumer offering within five weeks from concept to launch.
