Similarly, for their undergraduate degrees, they would succinctly convey their degree, honors received, representative roles, and international experience to reflect a well-rounded academic background.

Regarding their professional experience for the MBA resume entry, the candidate would use action verbs to describe their role and responsibilities as an MBA intern.
