Company Description
Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.


To solve this problem, we expanded into software and built integrated solutions to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.


Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

If you're looking to work at a high-growth company, drive impact on widely used products and change the way the restaurant industry works on a global scale you will find this role compelling, challenging, and rewarding.


You Will:

3. By introducing WhatsApp-based phone verification to combat unreliable cell service, we noticed a 5% increase in user onboarding.
4. I have also contributed to the hiring process by leading over 45 candidate interviews across various levels within our product team.
5. Prior to Brex, my stint at Microsoft, Redmond as a Product Manager saw me lead the creation of the simplified view of the M365 Admin Center, resulting in +12% NPS.
6. I was instrumental in growing the active usage count from 1,000 to 1 million monthly users in one year and led an initiative to grow the Admin Center’s business.

8. At the HCI Lab, Brown University, I designed predictive sleep models by analyzing an enormous amount of sleep data from a vast number of users, which provided personalized insights on better sleep.
9. Alongside these, I've also been active in the World Economic Forum as a Global Shaper, where I managed to raise $900k by writing grants and fundraising for land equity and repatriation to the Duwamish tribe.
10. With an entrepreneurial streak, I co-founded Pampr.us, where we built an AI-based skincare recommendations app by conducting extensive user research and functional prototyping.
11. My other entrepreneurial venture, Humans AI in India, saw me drive client acquisition and product development, providing alternative income for over 50 marginalized families.
Explanation: Because this position requires a product manager with experience in consumer-facing product management and strong customer empathy, the resume should benefit from the applicant's demonstrable success in launching user-centric features at Brex (like user onboarding improvements that led to a 10% increase in onboarding rates) and the experience at Microsoft in driving user growth and NPS improvement. Because the role involves leading cross-functional teams and navigating product scale challenges in a high-growth environment, the resume should benefit from the applicant's leadership in prioritizing features with a 20-person team and expanding usage from 1,000 to 1 million monthly users at Microsoft. Because the role calls for a growth mindset and detail-orientation, the resume should benefit from mentioning the introduction of WhatsApp-based phone verification at Brex and developing predictive sleep models at HCI Lab. Because the role requires managing cross-functional collaboration and execution, the applicant's experience in leading over 45 candidate interviews and co-founding ventures like Pampr.us and Humans AI indicates well-rounded team management and entrepreneurship skills, valuable for a high-impact role at Square. Lastly, the role requires someone with a passion for economic empowerment, and the applicant's involvement with the World Economic Forum and fundraising for the Duwamish tribe showcases a commitment to social impact matching the company’s values.

Notes: During my stint as a Strategic Partnerships Intern at Pamir Energy in Tajikistan from June to August 2018, I authored two executive papers for the briefing of the Executive Committee of the Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development. I was also instrumental in developing a $36.8 million partnership proposal with USAID, focusing on an electrification project that would benefit over 680,000 people. Alongside a team of two, I created a $600k partnership proposal with Masdar Renewable Energy, UAE.

Prior to this, in the role of a Summer Analyst at Altman Vilandrie & Co., I developed a comprehensive video strategy for a $195 billion telecom firm between May and July 2017 in Boston, which involved analyzing consumption trends across four business segments. I evaluated seven video content providers to identify potential synergies with the client’s two existing video offerings. An enormous quantity of data from an autonomous vehicle survey of 5000 individuals was analyzed to understand shifting consumer preferences. I conducted over 100 market simulations using conjoint analysis to identify price points for hypothetical vehicle offerings.

In April 2009, I founded 1 Well 700 Lives in Dubai, UAE. Through various initiatives, I provided access to clean drinking water for over 25,000 individuals in 36 Afghan villages. By reaching out to over 100 potential donors, I managed to raise more than USD 72,000 to construct 36 water wells. I also gave two TEDx speeches and appeared on national TV three times as part of our outreach activity, reaching over 7,000 people in total.

I held the position of Vice President at TEDxBrownU between April 2015 and March 2018. I led a team of 20 volunteers to curate TEDx conferences, manage the speaker selection process, provide feedback, and establish core Key Performance Indicators for marketing.

As President of Buxton International House between October 2015 and November  2016, I managed a $25,000 budget, organized multiple programs, and maintained high member retention rates by accommodating the cultural needs of 26 different countries.

I interned as a Strategy Intern at CO OP Brand Partners, New York, NY, in the summer of 2016. During this time, I led interviews with over 40 stakeholders to identify the final target market segment for a real estate development. I performed SWOT analysis, synthesized data, and developed the final brand strategy for the client.
Explanation: Because this position requires strong analytical skills and successful management of business challenges, the resume should benefit from the applicant's experience in developing comprehensive strategies for large firms, such as the $195 billion telecom firm video strategy and the partnership proposals created at Pamir Energy. Because the role values creative thinking and independent thought, the establishment and leadership of the initiative "1 Well 700 Lives" in Dubai, which showcased the ability to conceptualize and deliver a complex project, should be especially persuasive. Because the position demands excellent interpersonal skills and the ability to work within a team, the applicant's leadership roles at TEDxBrownU and Buxton International House, where they successfully managed diverse teams and projects, will be highly relevant. Finally, because the role expects the candidate to be deadline-driven with strong multi-tasking skills, the experience with Altman Vilandrie & Co., where the applicant handled substantial data analysis and market simulations under tight time constraints, will demonstrate the candidate's capability in this area.

Notes: At Citigroup Inc., I worked as a Quantitative Analyst where I studied various computational errors like discretization, truncation, and interpolation. I was able to manage those errors within given constraints. I was responsible for finding appropriate values of various parameters including the dampening factor in the CGMY model. In this role, I priced financial derivatives using numerical methods such as trapezoidal and Simpson's rules in the aforementioned model. I have experience using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to effectively price a large number of contracts with required precision. I developed a novel method for more effective contract pricing using the Hilbert Transform, which drastically improved both pricing accuracy and computational cost. I also supported managers with trade approvals and assisted the finance department with price verification methodologies.

During my time as an Intern Quantitative Researcher at Investment Technology Group Inc., I assisted in the creation of proprietary options pricing models. The models we built led to enhanced pricing accuracy and computational efficacy. I contributed to the development of algorithms for the company's Multi-Asset Execution Management Systems (MAEMS). I'm adept in the application of various financial derivative models for quantitative analysis of private equity investments, employing C++ programming. I formulated formal models of risk, return, and trading cost profiles for firm-wide asset classes, including equities.

At CITIC Securities Co. Ltd., I worked in the capacity of a Credit Risk Model Validation Analyst. I rigorously tested risk models through sensitivity analysis, extreme value testing, uncertainty analysis, backtesting, and benchmarking. This aimed at effectively challenging the models. In context to the CCAR/DFAST regulatory framework, I evaluated the appropriateness of model utilization. I indentified inappropriate use of the equity replication model in a project related to counterparty credit risk exposure and rectified it. In conclusion, I compiled comprehensive independent validation reports, describing the analytical tasks undertaken and their resultant outcomes.
Explanation: Because this position requires expertise in a high-level programming language such as Python or R, the resume should benefit from highlighting the applicant’s proficiency in C++ programming, which is also a high-level programming language, and their experience with applying numerical methods such as FFT and the Hilbert Transform for computational tasks, which showcases their programming skill set.

Because the job description emphasizes a detailed understanding of Market Microstructure, the resume should benefit from mentioning the applicant's experience with pricing financial derivatives and developing proprietary options pricing models, which implies a robust understanding of financial markets and market mechanisms.

Because the position values experience in analyzing OTC data and Exchange Traded Data, the resume should benefit from the applicant's role in price verification methodologies at Citigroup Inc. This demonstrates their familiarity with data analysis in financial contexts.

Because the role requires a hands-on attitude and willingness to get involved with technology and projects across the firm, the resume should benefit from the applicant's demonstrated experience in developing new methodologies for contract pricing, assisting in algorithm development for a Multi-Asset Execution Management System, and various other technical contributions that suggest a proactive approach to technology and project involvement.

Because the position demands 5+ years of experience trading in a financial institution, the resume should benefit from the comprehensive experience the applicant has across multiple roles at established financial institutions such as Citigroup Inc. and CITIC Securities Co. Ltd., which shows a progression of responsibility and relevance to the trading industry.

Because the candidate must have a strong academic record and a degree with high mathematical, statistical, and computing content, the resume should benefit from the applicant’s implied strong academic background due to their involvement in highly technical roles that require advanced financial and mathematical modeling techniques.

Finally, because the position necessitates strong interpersonal skills for communication across investment management teams and regions, the resume should benefit from the experience the applicant has in writing comprehensive reports and assisting managers, demonstrating their capability to communicate complex quantitative findings to different stakeholders.

Notes: I have a strong interest in filmmaking and possess over three years of experience in account acquisition, product lifecycle management, and growth strategies that I cultivated during my time at Palantir. I am looking forward to applying my technical expertise and strategic insights to contribute to Pika's pioneering product leadership, foster its growth, and boost its adoption.

In my previous role, I successfully led the development of custom enterprise products, generating revenue of $24 million across various accounts. This success was achieved through identifying market opportunities, creating user-focused solutions, and building robust relationships at all levels within the organization, from end-users to executive suite. More recently, I was at the helm of a 12-person engineering team where I drove the acquisition and upscaling of manufacturing accounts by developing custom AI solutions.

Since July, I have been conducting a series of hackathons and bootcamps for technical users. These efforts have resulted in nine new contracts and increased active engagement with existing clients. My role at Palantir and for our clients encompassed everything from product roadmap planning and execution to designing architecture, scoping use cases, and fostering user community growth.

I am particularly proud of leading the design and implementation efforts for Palantir's Scenarios product as the primary user-facing associate. This product was adopted by our entire user base within six months of launch thanks to simplified UX, scalable workflows, and successful client showcases.

I believe in the power of collaboration and always seek to work with teams composed of individuals who are exceptional, kind-hearted, and motivated by collective achievement. I'm committed to providing the resources my team needs, fostering a sense of shared responsibility, and ensuring skills are allocated in a way that meets the business needs effectively.
